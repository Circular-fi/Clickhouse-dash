# Trace Explorer

ChDash can read OpenTelemetry traces stored by the OpenTelemetry Collector contrib ClickHouse exporter. The viewer follows the ClickHouse host selected in the UI and uses that host's `system_uri`.

## Configuration

```hcl
traces {
  enabled                  = true
  database                 = "otel"
  table                    = "otel_traces"
  trace_index_table        = "otel_traces_trace_id_ts"
  service_allowlist        = ["*"]
  default_lookback_minutes = 60
  max_lookback_minutes     = 10080
  search_limit             = 100
  max_spans_per_trace      = 10000

  features {
    service_filter      = true
    operation_filter    = true
    status_filter       = true
    duration_filter     = true
    resource_attributes = true
    span_attributes     = true
    events              = true
    links               = true
  }
}
```

`service_allowlist` is enforced in backend-generated SQL and applies to search and direct TraceId URLs. `"*"` grants access to every service. Exact names and glob patterns may be mixed:

```hcl
service_allowlist = ["api", "test_*", "*_worker", "payments-*-consumer"]
```

`test_*` means every `ServiceName` starting with `test_`. An empty list denies every service. If a trace crosses allowed and denied services, only allowed spans are returned and hidden parent IDs are removed from the response.

## Direct TraceId URLs

A trace can be opened directly at:

```text
/traces/<trace-id>
```

Direct TraceId lookup is not limited by `max_lookback_minutes`. ChDash first uses `trace_index_table` to resolve the timestamp window. If that auxiliary table is unavailable, it performs an exact all-history lookup for the TraceId, restricted by `service_allowlist`, and then reads the trace through the recovered time window.

## Synthetic demo traces

`examples/generate_otel_traces.py` creates domain-neutral fixture data intended to stress the viewer with realistic distributed-system complexity rather than tiny toy traces. Defaults are 10,000 traces with 60–90 spans each across HTTP ingress, authentication, Kafka producers/consumers, processing and enrichment workers, cache calls, ClickHouse writes, notification delivery, nested/parallel branches, events, links, and occasional errors.

```bash
python3 examples/generate_otel_traces.py \
  --traces 100 \
  --seed 20260918 \
  --output-dir /tmp/chdash-otel
```

For the repository test stack no manual import is required. From `tests/`, a normal:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

builds and runs the one-shot `otel_fixture` service before ChDash starts. It recreates `otel.otel_traces` and `otel.otel_traces_trace_id_ts`, generates the synthetic traces, inserts both datasets, grants the ChDash system account read access, and exits successfully. `chdash_source` waits for this seed step through `service_completed_successfully`.

The generated services include `test_ingest`, `test_worker`, and `test_enrichment`, so this access-control case is immediately testable:

```hcl
service_allowlist = ["test_*"]
```
